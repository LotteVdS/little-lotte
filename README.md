Welcome to **little-lotte**, a lyrical experiment.  

This isn‚Äôt just a music player.  
This is a **stage**.  
Every song is a scene, every lyric a mask, and every annotation a tiny chandelier swinging overhead.

### What‚Äôs inside?  
- Curated **playlists** (linked from Dropbox)  
- **Lyric sheets** you can scroll through and discover annotations within
- Tooltips that look like highlights: hover, click, discover  
- A Phantom-inspired aesthetic that blends minimalism with just a touch of velvet drama

### Why ‚Äúlittle-lotte‚Äù?  
In 2025, I discovered a new, healthy coping mechanism for the first time in my life. I used to surpress a lot of feelings, especially the negative ones by being ashamed of them, trying to be positive, pretending they didn't exist etc.
Then in therapy, I learned the hard way that ignoring them only hurt me more in the end. 
Instead, I found a way to bottle the emotions I was experiencing, no matter how negative, contradicting or complex they were.
I poured them into song lyrics and created actual tunes out of it with the aid of AI. 
This place is my place to curate them in case I ever want to revisit them.

### Status
